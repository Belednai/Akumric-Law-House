# Deployment Guide for Akumric Law House Website

## Issue: Direct URL Access Not Working

When users try to access URLs like `https://www.akumriclawhouse.com/article/fictitious-bias` directly, they get a 404 error. This is a common issue with Single Page Applications (SPAs) like React apps.

## Solution: Server Configuration

I've created configuration files for different hosting platforms to fix this issue:

### 1. Apache Servers (Most Shared Hosting)
**File:** `public/.htaccess`
```apache
Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]
```

### 2. Vercel
**File:** `vercel.json`
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Netlify
**File:** `public/_redirects`
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Build and Upload
1. Run the build command:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your web server
3. Make sure the appropriate configuration file is in place

### Option 2: Automatic Deployment
If you're using a platform like Vercel or Netlify, just push your code to GitHub and they'll automatically deploy with the configuration files.

## Testing the Fix

After deployment, these URLs should work:
- `https://www.akumriclawhouse.com/article/fictitious-bias`
- `https://www.akumriclawhouse.com/blog`
- `https://www.akumriclawhouse.com/team`
- Any other React Router route

## What These Files Do

These configuration files tell the web server:
1. For any request that doesn't match a real file
2. Serve the `index.html` file instead
3. Let React Router handle the routing on the client side

This ensures that all routes work both when accessed directly and when navigated to within the app.

## Current Status

✅ All configuration files created
✅ Article page fully functional
✅ Routing properly set up
✅ Ready for deployment

The article "Fictitious Bias" is now ready to be shared with the direct URL once deployed with the proper server configuration.
